# Contributing to Cosmos

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you created a new component make sure to add a {component}.stories.tsx file
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue a pull request!


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/CaltechOpticalObservatories/cosmos/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/CaltechOpticalObservatories/cosmos/issues/new); it's that easy!


## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
  - What's the expected outcome?
  - What actually happens?
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)


## Setting up Your Development Environment
To get started with the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. To run tests, execute `npm run test`.
4. To start Storybook, use `npm run storybook` to see your components in action.

Happy contributing!
